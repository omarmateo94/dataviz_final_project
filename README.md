The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find Project 01. This project is to apply the concepts learned through the course. I decided to use the data set of U.S. births. After analyzing using different visualizations, I found out that the highest peak of births was in 2007; however, after that, it decreased drastically. It will be interesting to compare this with the family's economy since I feel it might be related to the economic crisis of 2008.

I also searched throw the months to find out what is the month with the highest number of births. I have always heard that October/November has the highest number of births because of St. Valentine's Day in February; after looking at the graph, I can confirm that this legend is false.

## Project 02

This project explores different trends on democrat voters through the years.

The project propose different graphs to visualize the data and get a better understanding of how the votes have been evolving though the years. Some of the visualizations, such as the map, can give a better understanding of what areas are tending to vote for democrats. Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.

(you can place your figures in the `figures/` folder and use the `![](path_to_picture)` option to add the pictures here)


## Project 03

In this project, I explored methods to create different types of data visualizations using the dataset obtained from FSUâ€™s Florida Climate Center, for a station at Tampa International Airport (TPA) for 2022.

### Moving Forward

I would love to take this class during fall or spring. Due my work and classes, it is difficult to improve my projects since there is not really much time. I have laerned a lot and I want to practice outside of class in a more slower pace.
