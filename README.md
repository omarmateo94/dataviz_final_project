The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find Project 01. This project is to apply the concepts learned through the course. I decided to use the data set of U.S. births. After analyzing using different visualizations, I found out that the highest peak of births was in 2007; however, after that, it decreased drastically. It will be interesting to compare this with the family's economy since I feel it might be related to the economic crisis of 2008.

I also searched throw the months to find out what is the month with the highest number of births. I have always heard that October/November has the highest number of births because of St. Valentine's Day in February; after looking at the graph, I can confirm that this legend is false.

## Project 02

This project explores different trends on democrat voters through the years.

The project propose different graphs to visualize the data and get a better understanding of how the votes have been evolving though the years. Some of the visualizations, such as the map, can give a better understanding of what areas are tending to vote for democrats. Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.
